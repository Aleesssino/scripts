# Easy Setup for LazyVim

This script is for easy setup of the necessary tools for using LazyVim. It ensures that Neovim (version 0.9.0 or later), Git, GCC, and the JetBrains Mono Nerd Font are installed on your system.

## How to Use This Script

1. **Download the Script**

   Save the script to a file named `install_tools.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_tools.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script by running:

   ```bash
   ./install_tools.sh
   ```

The script will check if the required tools are already installed on your system. If any tool is missing, it will be installed automatically.
